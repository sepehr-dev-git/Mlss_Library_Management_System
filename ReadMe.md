- **🗂️ Category Listings Page**: Displays a list of categories with search and filter options.
- **📋 User Dashboard**: Allows users to manage their profile, view issued books, and submit feedback.
- **🛠️ Librarian Dashboard**: Provides access to administrative functions such as adding/editing books, managing users, and reviewing feedback.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The Library Management System employs a relational database model using SQLite to manage various entities efficiently. The database schema includes tables for the following entities:

- **👥 Users**: Stores information about registered users including user ID, username, password, email, and role (user or librarian).
